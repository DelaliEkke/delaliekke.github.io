Project Story

So most important thing is that I want to draw curves, lines, and short dashes etc on the right side of the panel or webpage... And I want users to be able to click on any line or curve, and move themâ€¦
Do you think this is doable? 
 
I'll provide the code for the lines, curves, etc though...

THESE ARE THE FUNCTIONALITIES WE SHOULD CONSIDER. INSTEAD OF DOING THEM INDEPENDENTLY FOR EACH LINE, I THINK WE SHOULD FIND A WAY TO IMPLEMENT IT FOR ANYTHING DRAWN ON THE CANVAS. 
 
 
- Move: You can reposition the line anywhere on the canvas.
 
- Rotate: The line can be rotated to any angle.
 
- Resize/Scale: You can make the line longer or shorter, thicker or thinner.
 
- Duplicate/Copy: Create an exact copy of the line and place it elsewhere on the canvas.
 
- Delete: Remove the line from the canvas.
 
- Change Color: Alter the color of the line.
 
- Change Style: Modify the line to be dashed, dotted, or have arrows at the ends.
 
- Adjust Opacity: Change the transparency of the line.
 

- Layering: Move the line forward or backward in the layer stack relative to other elements.
 
Grouping: Combine the line with other elements so that they can be moved or transformed as a single object.
 
- Locking: Lock the line in place to prevent any changes.
 
- Annotate: Add labels or comments to the line.
 
Bend/Warp: Change the line from straight to curved or to any arbitrary shape.
 
Path Editing: Adjust the line by moving its control points if it's a Bezier curve.
 
- Snapping: Enable snapping to grid or other objects to align the line precisely.
 
Stroke Weight Adjustment: Change the thickness of the line.
 
Stroke Pattern: Modify the pattern of the line's stroke for different artistic effects.
 
Convert to Shape: Convert the line to a shape object that can be filled with color.
 
Add Effects: Apply effects like shadows, glow, or blurring to the line.
 
Extend or Trim: Lengthen or shorten the line without changing its starting point.
 
Blend Mode: Change how the line's color blends with colors beneath it.
 
Export: Save the line as part of an image or vector graphic for use in other documents.
 
Bind to a Function: If the canvas is part of a graphical interface, you can bind the line to a function or action to occur when it's clicked or hovered over.
 
Scripting: For canvases that support scripting, you could write code to control the line's behavior or appearance dynamically.




















Additional Shapes: Besides lines, implementing other shapes like rectangles, circles, or polygons.
Layer Management: Allowing users to work with multiple layers for more complex drawings.
Undo/Redo Functionality: Implementing an undo/redo system to enhance user experience.
Export Options: Providing options to save or export the canvas content as an image file.
Touch Support: Extending functionality for touch devices for a broader user base.
Customization Options: Adding more customization options for lines and shapes, such as gradient fills or patterned strokes.
